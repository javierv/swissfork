Swissfork
=========

Swissfork is a library to manage tournaments using the Swiss pairing system.

It's curerntly in early development stages, and expect development to be slow ;). Current development is focused on implementing a pairing algorithm for non-chess tournaments; chess tournaments will be supported after that by adding color preferences.

TODO
----

1. Colour preferences (for chess tournaments).
2. API to manage a whole tournament and not just a round.
3. Import and export files coded in the FIDE Data Exchange Format.
4. Pairings checker.
5. Random Tournament Generator.
