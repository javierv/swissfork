Swissfork

Swissfork is a library to manage tournaments using the Swiss pairing system.

It's currently in early development stages. Current development is focused on implementing a pairing algorithm following FIDE Ducth System (the updated 2016 version).

1. API to manage a whole tournament and not just a round.
2. Import and export files coded in the FIDE Data Exchange Format.
